<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Setup Resources in Azure
- Ensure Connectivity between the client and Domain Controller
- Install Active Directory
- Create an Admin and Normal User Account in AD
- Join Client-1 to your domain (mydomain.com)
- Setup Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1
- Create a bunch of additional users and attempt to log into client-1 with one of the users

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>
1 Setting up resources in Azure
- - Create a Windows Server named DC-1 (Domain Controller 1).
  - - Username: Labuser / Password: Password1234 (do not forget your password)
  - go to the DC1 folder in Azure and set the NIC Private IP address to static.
  - - Click on Networking -> dc1519(yours should be different) -> IP configurations -> ipconfig1 -> Allocation to Static.

- - Create the client's virtual machine named "Client1." Note: Use the same VNET from DC1.

2 Make sure there is a connection between the Client1 and DC1.
- Login to Client1 with Remote Desktop and ping DC1â€™s private IP address with -t <ip address> command on
